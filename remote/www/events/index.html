          Does frontend development sound scary or intriguing? Then, come join
          us for this class and discover more! Frontend frameworks are not that
          different from  backend frameworks. They are also MV*, and even if
          some of them are very different to what we are used to in the
          "backend world", some of them are really close to what we are used to
          with Django.

      <p>
        Tired of trying to check your code by hand?  Interested in testing
        but not sure where to begin?  This class will teach you the basics of testing
        in Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll cover:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The pros and cons of testing your code, and when it's most important to do
            so.
          </li>

          <li>
            How to make a simple set of tests using unit tests, included basic building
            blocks like assertions and setUp/tearDown. (Don't know what those terms mean
            yet?  That's what the class is for!)
          </li>

          <li>
            The Coverage tool, which helps you track how much of your code has tests.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll also briefly talk about more advanced testing topics, such as mocks,
        factories, integration testing with Selenium, automated testing, and test
        driven development, just to give folks a lay of the testing landscape.  :)

      Introduction to Computational Linguistics with Python

      <p>
          A brief introduction to Computational Linguistics by Giovanni De Gasperis, where we'll do
          some basic analyses by writing small Python programs.
          Computational Linguistics is a multidisciplinary research area where linguists and computer
          scientists collaborate to analyze unstructured text in its primitive form, i.e. not
          actually trying to read it and doing natural language understanding, but more specifically
          calculating statistical properties out of large text corpora, independently from the
          language by which the text has been produced.
          Typical results are: the most occurrent text forms in absolute or in relation to other
          forms, extract most significant keywords, build the corpus vocabulary. More advanced
          results are lemmatization, part of speech tagging, semantic categories tagging and much
          more.
          A text will be downloaded from the web and it will be analyzed writing small Python
          programs that can produce some of the basic results mentioned above.

        Your First Conference Proposal!</a>
      </dt>
      <dd class="meetup_event_description">
        <p>Speaking at conferences is a great way to get to know new people, travel the country (and the world!), learn new techniques,
          and network with other developers. But submitting your first conference presentation can be daunting.
          You might not be sure how much detail to include or how formal to me. You might even think that your perspective isn't valuable.</p>
        <p>In this PyLadies Remote class, we'll start with a discussion of impostor syndrome and how you can overcome it to start your
          speaking career. Multiple and diverse voices add value to all conferences, so we'll talk about how to get yourself a speaker
          mentor, how to build confidence, and the importance of rehearsal. Then we'll get into the nitty gritty of what conferences
          are looking for in a proposal. By the end of the meeting, you'll have a list of conferences to apply for, some ideas for what
          to present, and a plan for giving your first conference talk in 2016.</p>

            <li><p>We'll install a stlightly prepared django project using cookiecutter in order to save time (with preloaded bootstrap, custom css, required apps already installed, db initialized with superuser)</p></li>
            <li><p>We'll jump directly into urls.py (with explanation on how a django/wsgi app is different from basics html/php/asp/jsp based sites if part of the audience has experience with those)</p></li>
            <li><p>We'll have a brief intro of TemplateView and Django templates and template inheritance.</p></li>
            <li><p>We'll do a complete intro on models/makemigrations/migrate</p></li>
            <li><p>We'll have a brief description of the admin and how to create a ModelAdmin</p></li>
            <li><p>We'll move towards ListView, CreateView and UpdateView</p></li>
            <li><p>We'll create a custom View class (to set a todo as done from the list) based on RedirectView</li></p>

          <p>If there's time left:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>We'll do an ajax version of the last step so the page doesn't need to be reloaded when setting a todo as done and see how django can behave differently for ajax and regular requests</p></li>

          will teach you the basics of Python! And the best part about it: You can
          take the class from home, in your PJ's!</p>
          <p>This is a class for absolutely beginners, so don't worry about
            not having enough experience.</p>
          <p>Katie will cover:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>What is Python, and what can it do?</p></li>
            <li><p>Saving data</p></li>
            <li><p>Manipulating data</p></li>
            <li><p>Data types</p></li>
            <li><p>Repeating code</p></li>
            <li><p>Creating functions</p></li>
            <li><p>Using the Python Standard Library</li></p>
            <li><p>What next?</li></p>
          </ul>
          <p>For this class, Katie will be using <a href="https://c9.io">Cloud 9</a>.
            You can feel free to use the Python installed on your machine, but it's much,
            MUCH easier to share errors with Katie when you use Cloud 9.</p>
          <p>Class pre-requisites:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>A stable Internet connection
              (please, don't do this from a coffee shop!)</p></li>
            <li><p>A Cloud 9 account (it's free!)</p></li>
            <li><p>Some caffeine :) </p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Sign up for the class <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/learn-python-in-your-pjs-tickets-17362458581">here!</a></p>
          <p>An email with the link to the Google Hangout on Air and the

        Tired of trying to check your code by hand?  Interested in testing
        but not sure where to begin?  This class will teach you the basics of testing
        in Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll cover:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The pros and cons of testing your code, and when it's most important to do
          so.
        </li>

        <li>
          How to make a simple set of tests using unit tests, included basic building
          blocks like assertions and setUp/tearDown. (Don't know what those terms mean
          yet?  That's what the class is for!)
        </li>

        <li>
          The Coverage tool, which helps you track how much of your code has tests.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We'll also briefly talk about more advanced testing topics, such as mocks,
        factories, integration testing with Selenium, automated testing, and test
        driven development, just to give folks a lay of the testing landscape.  :)

    <p>
        A brief introduction to Computational Linguistics by Giovanni De Gasperis, where we'll do
        some basic analyses by writing small Python programs.
        Computational Linguistics is a multidisciplinary research area where linguists and computer
        scientists collaborate to analyze unstructured text in its primitive form, i.e. not
        actually trying to read it and doing natural language understanding, but more specifically
        calculating statistical properties out of large text corpora, independently from the
        language by which the text has been produced.
        Typical results are: the most occurrent text forms in absolute or in relation to other
        forms, extract most significant keywords, build the corpus vocabulary. More advanced
        results are lemmatization, part of speech tagging, semantic categories tagging and much
        more.
        A text will be downloaded from the web and it will be analyzed writing small Python
        programs that can produce some of the basic results mentioned above.

      <p>Speaking at conferences is a great way to get to know new people, travel the country (and the world!), learn new techniques,
        and network with other developers. But submitting your first conference presentation can be daunting.
        You might not be sure how much detail to include or how formal to me. You might even think that your perspective isn't valuable.</p>
      <p>In this PyLadies Remote class, we'll start with a discussion of impostor syndrome and how you can overcome it to start your
        speaking career. Multiple and diverse voices add value to all conferences, so we'll talk about how to get yourself a speaker
        mentor, how to build confidence, and the importance of rehearsal. Then we'll get into the nitty gritty of what conferences
        are looking for in a proposal. By the end of the meeting, you'll have a list of conferences to apply for, some ideas for what
        to present, and a plan for giving your first conference talk in 2016.</p>

      <p>Here are the steps that she will guide you through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We'll install a stlightly prepared django project using cookiecutter in order to save time (with preloaded bootstrap, custom css, required apps already installed, db initialized with superuser)</li>
        <li>We'll jump directly into urls.py (with explanation on how a django/wsgi app is different from basics html/php/asp/jsp based sites if part of the audience has experience with those)</li>
        <li>We'll have a brief intro of TemplateView and Django templates and template inheritance.</li>
        <li>We'll do a complete intro on models/makemigrations/migrate</li>
        <li>We'll have a brief description of the admin and how to create a ModelAdmin</li>
        <li>We'll move towards ListView, CreateView and UpdateView</li>
        <li>We'll create a custom View class (to set a todo as done from the list) based on RedirectView</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If there's time left:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We'll do an ajax version of the last step so the page doesn't need to be reloaded when setting a todo as done and see how django can behave differently for ajax and regular requests</li>

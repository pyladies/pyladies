# PyLadies Uy

We are the Uruguay chapter of an international mentorship group, PyLadies,
with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders
in the Python open-source community. Our mission is to promote, educate and
advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences,
events and social gatherings.

PyLadies also aims to provide a friendly support network for
women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an
interest in Python is encouraged to participate!

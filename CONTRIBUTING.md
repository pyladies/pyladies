# PyLadies Blog Guest Post Guidelines

We accept guest posts for the PyLadies blog. Here is a guest post that you should read as samples of what we're looking for:

* [Get the Most Out of Your Conference-Going Experience][2]

## Topics

We're looking for posts about Python and the ladies doing cool things with it. Our audience includes both experts and newer programmers. If you're writing a more expert level post, consider pointing newer programmers to resources to get started with.

Note: we reserve the right to decline posts, or work to improve the work of the post. 

## Attribution

Cite your courses! Either link to them in your post, or the old-fashioned academic Chicago MLA style of "quoting someone's work"(Root) with an entry for "Root" at the bottom of your post (or any ohter MLA styling).

**Also** Please include whether:

1. You want to be noted as the author
2. If so, what name you want to use
3. If we can link to you somehow, either through Twitter handle, email, or website.

Anonymous submissions are fine.

## Length

Posts should be 500 words in length. If your post is much longer (thousands of words), consider whether it could be broken into two connected posts.

## Images

If you wish to include images, they must be 500 pixels wide or less. You must own the images you're submitting, or they must be available under a Creative Commons license.

## Formatting

* **Write your guest post in Markdown**. Here are tools to help:
  * Mou.app for mac is created for Markdown - gives you a preview while you write
  * http://dillinger.io/ is a web app that provides a live preview when you're writing in Markdown
  * A cheatsheet for Markdown commands is at [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax][1].

* **Include the following at the top** (including the three dashes before and after):

```
---
layout: post.html
title: "Your title here"
tags: [list, of relevant, tags]
author: Name, or blank/none
author_link: Twitter/Blog/etc or blank/none
---
```

## Submission Method

To submit your post:

1. Save the file in _posts.

2. Test your changes locally. Start up mynt as per the [instructions in our README](https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies#to-run-locally).

In order to have an issue assigned to you, you'll need to be a member of the [PyLadies Contributor Team](https://github.com/orgs/pyladies/teams/contributors); just add a message on the issue you'd like to work on and we'll add you to the team so we can assign that issue to you. 

Note the labels: 

- bug
- design/front end 
- docs/update

If you're new to contributing to open source, or just new to contributing to the PyLadies repo, check out the "newbie friendly" tag. These are simpler issues that would be good for first-time contributors. You can also use the labels to find issues that are tailored to skills you have or skills you want to develop. 

Just fork the project, make your changes, and submit a pull request! Follow the setup instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies) to get the site running locally on your machine.

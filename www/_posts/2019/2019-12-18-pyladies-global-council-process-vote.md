PyLadies Global Council Selection Process Voting Now Open!
====================================================================================

The PyLadies Global Interim team has now opened voting for PyLadies Chapter organizers to select one of three proposals for how the inaugural PyLadies Global Council election will function. 

All information about voting can be found on the [PyLadies Global Organizing repository on issue #50](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/50).
The proposals have been translated by volunteer community members to various languages: Arabic, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese (Mandarin). We'd like to thank Python community members for stepping up and for helping PyLadies in the translation effort including Fadma Adam, Tania Allard, Debora Azevedo, Philippe Gagnon, Abdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer, Maria Ronacher, Elizaveta Shashkova, Ivy Fung, and volunteers in the Python Software Foundation Translation Workgroup.

Questions? Email `info@pyladies.com` or else ask in the [PyLadies Slack](https://slackin.pyladies.com/).

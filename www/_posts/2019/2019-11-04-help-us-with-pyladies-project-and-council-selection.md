Help us decide our PyLadies Projects and PyLadies Global Council Selection Process!
====================================================================================

The PyLadies Global Interim team has continued to meet monthly to discuss the future of our PyLadies Project teams and our PyLadies Global Council. 


### PyLadies Projects

We have an open [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/33) on selecting the initial PyLadies Projects we'd like to focus on. PyLadies Projects will be managed as open source projects and be focused to working on one specific area. For example, we have [PyLadies Technology and Infrastructure Project](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/35) proposal open. All Project teams are open to any self-identifying PyLadies member.

Please weigh in today on these teams! We will close the PyLadies Project issue on November 18 2019 23:59:59 Anywhere on Earth.

### Selecting the PyLadies Global Council

Additionally there is an open [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/32) discussing how the PyLadies Global Council selection process will work. If you have thoughts on how the selection should work, what requirements should be in place for Council members, or more please add your feedback on the issue today! We will close the PyLadies Project issue on November 18 2019 23:59:59 Anywhere on Earth.

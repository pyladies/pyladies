[PyLadies Austin](https://www.facebook.com/PyladiesAustin) hosted Austin's first ever Ladies-focussed Hackathon - Austin Ladies Hack,  from Aug 15th-17th, 2014.

On Friday, Ladies met at the Flying Saucer to meet with fellow hackers, discuss ideas and form teams. Thanks to the PSF, food at this event was free to all the ladies who attended. On the 2nd day, the hackers were treated to a yummy breakfast by hosts and sponsors Rackspace. 25 ladies formed 5 teams and promptly started hacking at 10:15 am. They took a brief break for lunch and continued till 5pm, after which some teams met at local coffee houses to continue working on their apps. On the last day, all the teams worked feverishly to finish their apps and presentations before lunch.

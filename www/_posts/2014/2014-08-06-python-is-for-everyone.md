We started PyLadies as a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python community.

The Python community has enthusiastically supported us in turn, and over the last few years, PyCon has seen a massive surge in diversity of speakers and attendees, and dozens of PyLadies chapters have emerged all over the world. 

We believe that tech should be accessible and welcoming to everybody, and we want other groups to be as successful as us. 

So, if you want to start a PyLGBT, PyMuslims, PyInuit, PyGreatestGeneration or other under-represented group, we have open-sourced our tools and resources for you to use. 

Our handbook and startup kit is here:

We encourage you to take it as a starting point and use it for your community.

And for support, encouragement, and advice, please join the PyDiversity mailing list:

https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/diversity

and we'll be there to help. 

Together, let's make Python awesome for everyone.

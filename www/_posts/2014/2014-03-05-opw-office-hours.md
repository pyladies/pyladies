PyLadies is proud to be working with the Python Software Foundation to support [paid Python internships for women this summer][pyfound] through the GNOME Outreach Program for Women.

[Please visit the project page for the full program details and how to apply!][apply]

Applications are due by __March 19th__. You do __not__ need to be a student to apply.

Part of the application process is submitting a patch for a bug in Python. Need help getting started? We're running __virtual office hours__ this Sunday.

**What**: Submit your first patch to Python!
**When**: Sunday, March 9th, from [12pm - 6pm Eastern (UTC - 5)][time].
**Where**: IRC, in the `#pyladies` channel on the `freenode` network.
**Who**: Anyone interested in contributing to Python. While we particularly encourage prospective OPW and Google Summer of Code interns to attend, this event is open to everyone.

These are unstructured office hours; you'll go through [this material on environment setup and contributing your first patch][docs] at your own pace, with support from a great group of mentors on IRC.

The [setup material][docs] includes instructions for installing an IRC client and joining the `#pyladies` IRC channel.

See you on Sunday!

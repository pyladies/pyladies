Are you interested in doing a women's Python workshop of your own in your city? Email any of the organizers and we'll help you get the word out. Here are some resources:

#### Workshops for Women

* [PyStar][pystar]
* [Montreal Python][montreal]

#### Community-building

Workshops are just one part of PyLadies' effort to increase the female count in the Python world. PyLadies is a community of female developers who care about helping other women get into Python.

We plan to put together a package of materials to help you build your own local women's Python community. We'll be posting a "PyLadies Kit" here soon.

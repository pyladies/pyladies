A caring community matters to us

"Thank you." "I'm so sorry." "Please forgive me."

These three simple phrases offer so much compassion and humanity when shared genuinely. As a child, I don't know that I learned how important those phrases are. Unlike some of you, I didn't hear those words often enough. 

I know that I am human. I have my successes and also my failures. It hurts me when I think that I may have hurt some one else. My optimistic hope for the world is that people will value and cherish other people. With no strings attached, a person is valuable simply because they are a person.

Now, those three simple yet powerful phrases are often used in my own adult life:

_"Thank you for..."_
    ...helping me learn how to code this feature.
    ...volunteering your time and talents.
    ...understanding that we are individuals with varying needs.
    ...being humane and compassionate to others and yourself.

_"I'm so sorry..."_
    ...that I arrived late to our meeting.
    ...that I am stressed and let my stress result in unwelcoming and unprofessional behavior.
    ...that I forgot to pause, check my privilege, and listen to you.

_"Please forgive me..."_
    ...for hurting you in any way. 
    ...for letting my stress spill over in to our conversation.
    ...for failing to understand your perspective.
    ...for speaking more than listening.

Here are a few more words I have found helpful as an adult:
    * Participate. 
    * Prioritize people. 
    * Proactively practice compassion and self-care.

Sometimes people act in ways that compel us to take a moment to pause and think about that person and their perspective. One humble PyLady's plan: When in doubt, please practice __People > Python__.

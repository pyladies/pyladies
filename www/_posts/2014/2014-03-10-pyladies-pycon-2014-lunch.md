More than one hundred PyLadies attended last year's lunch at PyCon 2013, and this year the venue will be large enough to accommodate even more!  

In order to help the organizers plan the event, we **highly** recommend you procure your **free** ticket now, via the RSVP link below.

**Who** - Anybody attending PyCon 2014 who identifies as a woman
**When** - Sunday, April 13, 2014 during lunch
**Where** - Room 516 at the Convention Ctr
**RSVP** - [Eventbrite][rsvp] - Free but  exclusive to conference attendees.

 The PyLadies Lunch is a great opportunity for women attending the conference who love Python, or who want to learn more about Python or PyLadies, to meet others in the same boat in a fun, relaxed environment.  

 We cordially invite you to join us and make new friends, forge connections, and share Python programming stories with folks from all around the world.

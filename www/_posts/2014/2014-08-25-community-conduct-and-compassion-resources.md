There are a number of excellent resources on creating healthy, inclusive steps for communities. These are just a few of them. If you think another PyLady would find a resource useful that is not on this list, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies) or [email the link to us](mailto:info@pyladies.com). Thank you!

The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community welcome and encourage participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.

Equally important, we expect all participants in the PyLadies community to follow the [Code of Conduct](/CodeOfConduct/) so that everyone can feel safe and welcome at all PyLadies events.

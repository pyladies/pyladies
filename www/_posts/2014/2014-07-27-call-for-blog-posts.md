PyLadies wants to hear your inspiring stories about Python programming and Python community leadership.

As our [contributing instructions][contributing_instructions] say: "We're looking for posts about Python and the ladies doing cool things with it."

Whether you run a PyLadies or [DjangoGirls] chapter, maintain a Python library, or are simply learning and want to show off your Python project, we want to hear about it and help share your successes with the world.

First read the [contributing instructions][contributing_instructions] for pyladies.com, then get started.

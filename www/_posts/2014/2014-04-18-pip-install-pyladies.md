At [PyCon][pycon] this year, I had the pleasure of [announcing][announcing] `pip install pyladies`.

Yes! You really *can* install a PyLadies package!  It's available on [PyPI][pypi], with the handbook portion available on [Read the Docs][rtds].

The `pyladies` package contains all that a PyLady needs to start her own local PyLadies:

* Complete handbook that walks through how to start a PyLadies group,
* A script that launches the handbook, with more functionality slated to be added, including:
	* Interactive script to submit initial interest form,
	* Interactive script to submit final registration form,
	* Tools to admins to interact with Twitter and Meetup APIs,
* Workshop materials for ideas and blueprints to run events,
* Images and other assets for swag printing, global and local logos, etc.

This is the bare minimum for a shippable viable product - so issues/ideas and pull requests are [welcomed][welcomed]!!

**TL;DR**: [Donate](#ways-to-donate) to PyLadies for PyCon!

With [PyCon 2015][0] planning in high gear, PyLadies is revving up to raise funds to help women attend the biggest Python conference of the year.

Just like last year, we're hoping to raise at least **$40,000** to help women attend this coming PyCon.  Here's the breakdown:

### Our numbers

* In addition to registration, it will take about $500-1000 per woman in North America to attend PyCon 2015 in Montreal
* In addition to registration, it will take about $1000-2000 per woman outside of North America to attend PyCon 2015 in Montreal
* We're using all of the $12k that PyLadies [raised at last year's PyCon auction][9] to increase the aid pool, in addition to raising $40,000.

### Why PyLadies? Our effect on the community
_(percentages are not at all accurate, and are roughly estimated based on guessing names-to-gender scripts):_

* PyCon 2011 had less than 10% women attendees (speaker % unknown)
* PyLadies started in late 2011
* PyCon 2012 had about 11% women attendees, and about the same in speakers. 2013 with about [14 chapters][7], PyCon had over 20% women attendees and 22% women speakers.
* For PyCon 2014, we saw that about one-third of attendees and speakers were women.
* No overhead - we're all volunteers! ;-)
* Lastly, donations tax deductible since PyLadies is under the financial enclave of the Python Software Foundation


### What you will get in return

* Unless you explicitly choose to be anonymous (though the [online donation site][5] or in private discussions), we will profusely thank you via our public channels (Twitter, this blog, and at our PyCon booth)
* Provide a detailed write-up and financial introspection of how many women we've helped because of this campaign
* Visibility! It shows the PyCon/Python community that your company/you are serious about women in tech - which can directly benefit sponsors with increased hiring pool of female Pythonistas.


### Ways to donate

All of the following methods are tax-deductible with funds going to the [Python Software Foundation][1], a 501(c)3 charitable organization.

* Through our [donation page][4] (ideal for individuals)
* Email me at [lynn@lynnroot.com][2] (ideal for companies or anyone needing a proper invoice, or individualized solutions)
* Become a [sponsor][6] for PyCon (this is more indirect and less potent, but overall helpful to PyCon)


More information is available on the [PyCon Financial Aid][5] site if you would like to apply for financial aid for PyCon, whether you are a PyLady or PyGent.

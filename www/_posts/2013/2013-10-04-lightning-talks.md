For the first time at [PyCon][0], you can submit a proposal to give a Lightning Talk!  If you missed the earlier call for proposals for the longer talks, you still have a chance to present your beloved subject in front of a large audience. 

The deadline is coming soon, so hurry up! You have until October 15th, 2013 to propose your 5-minute presentation. If your Lightning Talk is pre-accepted, you will have a reserved slot on the lightning talk schedule.

For those who enjoy spontaneity, don't worry!  We will embrace our tradition of accepting Lightning Talk proposals on site.

For more information on submission guidelines, check out our [How to Submit a Lightning Proposal][1], or get inspired by looking through previous year's [lightning talks][2].

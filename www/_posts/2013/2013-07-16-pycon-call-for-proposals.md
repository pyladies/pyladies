PyCon is the largest annual gathering for the Python community. It is a volunteer-run, supportive, happy, diverse conference for people of all programming backgrounds, from beginning to advanced Pythonistas and for professional and hobbyist programmers alike. The conference has tutorials, talks, poster sessions, development sprints, and more.

PyCon is in beautiful Montreal in April of 2014. Need help getting to PyCon? No problem: the conference has a robust financial aid problem (and the best way to ensure assistance is to be giving a talk).

Talks are 30 or 45 minutes long. Beginners can give talks. Hobbyists can give talks. You, yes you, would give a great talk on something that excites you about Python. Proposals are due by September 15th.

Check out:

* [Proposal resources][resources]

A great way to continue learning Python is to work on your own, then attend presentations and ask questions at local user groups. Attend as many as you can!

* Python groups on [Meetup.com][meetup]
* [Python.org list][pugs] of local user groups

If you are unable to find a local group, you can still communicate with people around the world on the #pyladies IRC channel, on FreeNode.

* Guide to getting started on [IRC][irc]

IRC is a great way to get in touch with open source developers around the world. Here's a guide to setting up an IRC nickname and joining the friendly #pyladies channel, a great way to get familiar with how IRC works.

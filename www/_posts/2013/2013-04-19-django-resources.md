[Django][django] is one of the most popular web frameworks. It's a great option if you want to use Python to build web apps.  Start with [the official Django poll tutorial][tutorial] or the [Django Girls tutorial][djangogirls].  [Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices For Django 1.8][twoscoops] was co-written by a PyLady - don't hesitate to ask for a free copy if you can't afford it.

Some popular Django hosting options:

* [Webfaction][webfaction]
* [Heroku][heroku] and [Getting Started with Django from Heroku][djangoheroku]: A tutorial using Django and deploying with Heroku.  Assumes some knowledge of virtual environments.
* [OpenShift][openshift]
* [Google App Engine][appengine]

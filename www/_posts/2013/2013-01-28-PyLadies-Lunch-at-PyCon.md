This year, there is such an amazing line up of talks, tutorials, events, and sponsors at [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org) that we're sure you don't have enough planned.  Us PyLadies have organized to host a lunch for women attending the conference who love Python, or who want to learn more about Python or PyLadies.

### What's this all about?

[PyLadies](http://pyladies.com "PyLadies Homepage") is a mentorship group for women in the Python community. Come join us for an opportunity to chat with your fellow female Pythonistas while taking a break from the jam-packed PyCon schedule.

**Who**: Women who love coding in Python

**When**: Saturday, March 16th, 12:30pm - 1:30pm
 
**Where**: Second floor, Rooms 209/210


We invite any **woman** conference-goer to lunch at an informal, friendly meet & greet to form connections, and share Python programming stories.

### RSVP!

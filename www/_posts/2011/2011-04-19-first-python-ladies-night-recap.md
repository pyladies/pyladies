title: First Python Ladies' Night Recap
tags: [Events]
---

On April 16, 2011, a group of 5 local female Python developers got together for the first ever Python ladies' night.

We had wine, sparkling elderflower and ginger waters, vegetable spaghetti, savory meat pies from Porto's bakery, Caesar salad, homemade garlic bread, tea, and tiramisu.

We talked about:

-   Python women's advocacy (mostly!)
-   virtualenv
-   the mod\_wsgi documentation
-   Django-based content management systems
-   how we each got into Python development

And we started plans for a women's Python workshop on May 15, 2011. Details about how to get tickets will be announced this week.

It was an exciting meeting with a lot of positive energy.  Everyone present was passionate about Python women's advocacy and wanted to help increase diversity in the local Python community.

At the end, we went up to the rooftop lounge, where we had a spectacular view of downtown LA.  Some of us relaxed in the jacuzzi, while others hung out and chatted poolside.

Our next ladies' night is scheduled for May 6, 2011.  If you'd like to come and get involved, please contact me at [audreyr@cartwheelweb.com](mailto:audreyr@cartwheelweb.com) for more details.

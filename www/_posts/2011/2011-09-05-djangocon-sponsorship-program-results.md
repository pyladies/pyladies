Announcing the results of the PyLadies' DjangoCon Sponsorship Program.

$4250 was raised, with 100% of it going to making it possible for female Django developers to attend DjangoCon.  Specifically, excited and passionate developers who would not otherwise have attended (who happen
to be women).

Here is a breakdown of how the money was used.  For more details about this, see our PyLadies / DjangoCon US 2011 Sponsorship Program financial report ([PDF download](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/768016/pyladies/financial-reports/PyLadies-DjangoConUS2011-Financial-Report.pdf)).

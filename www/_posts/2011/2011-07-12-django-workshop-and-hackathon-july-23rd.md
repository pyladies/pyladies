The PyLadies are continuing their summer series of hackathons with a Django-themed day on July 23rd, hosted by venue sponsor 
[Mahalo](http://mahalo.com) in Santa Monica. This time, we're teaming up with the awesome  [LA Django Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/ladjango/), who have valiantly supported our efforts to increase diversity by providing mentors like  [Jacob](https://twitter.com/jacobburch) and [Jeff](https://twitter.com/jeffschenck).

> The [Django web framework ](static/admin/blog/blogpost/add/www.djangoproject.com) is a
> great way to dive into Python while quickly building and deploying a
> simple and useful web application (like this blog, or even  [a whole startup](http://www.women2.org/from-web-designer-to-django-webapp-developer-tracy-osborn-launches-weddinginvitelove/)!),
> which is why beginners are highly encouraged to attend.
>
> Participants will begin by going through the  [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/tutorial01/) under
> the expert tutelage of PyLadies developers. In the afternoon,
> attendees are encouraged to hack away on their own projects.

As at the previous [hackathon in Hollywood](static/blog/recap-june-2011-hollywood-hackathon-at-border-stylo), mentors will be available throughout the day to help people on their individual projects and to answer any questions or resolve issues.

Like always, there will be a final hour of lightning talks (if you've attended our previous events, now might be a good time to consider presenting something yourself!). And of course there will a social hour following the event which is open to the whole Python community and its extended circles. You know how we love to party!

To register for this low-cost workshop (which includes breakfast, lunch and dinner), visit [http://pyladies-django-july.eventbrite.com](http://pyladies-django-july.eventbrite.com). For more information, email esther @ pyladies dot com.

P.S. Many thanks to the [Python Software Foundation](http://python.org/psf) for their generous support!

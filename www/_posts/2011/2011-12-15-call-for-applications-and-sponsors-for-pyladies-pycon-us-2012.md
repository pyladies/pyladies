[As previously mentioned](static/blog/pyladies-at-pycon-2012), the PyLadies are working with the PSF to ensure that PyLadies who want to attend [PyCon 2012](http://us.pycon.org/2012) can do so.  To that end,we are accepting [applications for grants to attend PyCon](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEtUbUZxZWN6V3FGdkVydEtvU2ZwMUE6MQ) in Santa Clara, CA from March 7-15.

Let's make PyCon as diverse as the Python Community as a whole -- if not more! Many thanks to the PSF for partnering with us on this initiative.

**Attendees**: If you are a female Python developer who wants to attend but needs financial assistance in order to do so, please [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEtUbUZxZWN6V3FGdkVydEtvU2ZwMUE6MQ) as soon as possible.

The application period for this year has ended. If you have not received a reply from us about the status of your application, please email esther @ pyladies com immediately.

**Sponsors**: If you are interested in providing financial assistance to a budding Python developer in need, please contact esther @ pyladies.com

[We did something similar this past year for DjangoCon](static/blog/djangocon-sponsorship-program-results), and plan to continue this program for as long as we can sustain it. If you can help us, you will helping to change the community, and maybe even a couple of lives!

How grant recipients will be chosen
-----------------------------------

Priority will be based on the following factors:

-   Genuine financial need
-   Talk proposal acceptance (those invited to speak at PyCon will have
    higher priority)
-   Level of experience in programming
-   Contributions to open-source
-   Contributions to Python diversity advocacy efforts
-   Desire to attend
-   Impact that attendance will have on her life, especially for
    first-time attendees

Sponsors will receive:

-   an email report from us about the person you're sponsoring, and why
    you made the right decision
-   your link listed on a page that we'll be putting up for sponsors
-   your logo displayed on that page, if you donate substantially more
    than others (amount TBD) and/or better placement
-   a personal guarantee from me that the PyLadies and I will mentor the
    person you sponsored.  We will help them through their Python career
    and put friendly pressure on them to contribute to open-source =)

Mid-August -- in France we'd be halfway through our nationally recognized four weeks of vacation, but here in Los Angeles we PyLadies have been as busy as ever, working hard to plan some big, big things!

Also:

-   Sophia and I wrote up [a short narrative](http://www.women2.org/pyladies-events-workshops-hackathons-and-startup-kits/) about our little group for Women 2.0
-   Katharine submitted a [panel proposal](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/11850) for SXSW Interactive next March -- please vote it up on the SXSW Panel Picker!
-   Audrey is delivering keynote speeches at [PyCon Australia](http://pycon-au.org/2011/conference/schedule/) AND [Kiwi PyCon](http://nz.pycon.org/2011/talks/talk/142/) in Wellington, New Zealand! There will also be a [women in Python breakfast](http://pycon-au.org/2011/conference/schedule/event/47/) at PyCon Australia before the keynote, so if you're in that other hemisphere and would like to attend, shoot Audrey an email.

And we do it all for YOU =)

**UPCOMING EVENTS**

Those who subscribe to the PyLadies newsletter should already know about the following events, but if you've been dilly-dallying about signing up for any, get thee quickly to those registration pages so we can be ready for you! (If you \*don't\* subscribe to our newsletter -- why not?? There's a handly little form for you on our sidebar RIGHT THERE --\> - The LA PyLadies have created a [Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/Pyladies-LA/) where we will post all our events -- join us! - It's not too late to register for this weekend's [Hacks/Hackers hackathon](http://meetupla.hackshackers.com/events/28337101/), held under the auspices of \#[PubCampWest](http://www.scpr.org/events/2011/08/19/pubcamp/) at KPCC in Pasadena. The theme is "Hacking online audio" - Monday is another PyLadies hack night -- an informal event where people can get together to work on code or just [hang out on IRC](static/chat) to do the same. Actually, we're always around on IRC, so if you're busy Monday, you can still hang out with us virtually on any other day you want! - Saturday, August 27th is the official [August PyLadies mini-conference/hackathon at Cars.com](http://pyladies-cars-august.eventbrite.com/). This all-day event will begin with a morning session of talks about Django and other cool Python tools, followed by a hackathon.

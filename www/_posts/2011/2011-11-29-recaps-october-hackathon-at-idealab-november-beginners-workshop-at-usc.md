[Idealab](http://idealab.com) in Pasadena played host to a PyLadies hackathon this past October. Our very own Sophia has posted some great photos of the event over at her own site, [backCODE](http://backcode.com/pyladies-hackathon-the-idea-lab/) -- check them out!

[USC's Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism](http://annenberg.usc.edu) hosted a beginner's Python workshop that was even bigger than the first one we held back in May. 50-odd geeks, nerds, and similar fought their way through some unexpected downtown traffic to attend this tutorial, taught by PyLadies kjam, Sandy, and xtine.

It was a bright crowd, with most people Learning Python the Hard Way at a fairly rapid clip. They were impatient to learn about web scraping from kjam, and eager to follow along with the code samples presented at the end-of-day lightning talks.

Photos from this event are up on our [Flickr page](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/sets/72157628083649345/)! BIG thanks to Geneva Oh of USC Annenberg and Prof. **Robert Hernandez**for proposing, organizing and promoting this workshop for USC students and journalists (including one intrepid nerd-to-be who flew in from Arizona solely for this event!), as well as sponsoring the venue and food.

Lightning talks from

**xtine**: scraping data from a music website for fun!

**Michael**: Why Documentation Matters

**Robin**: [Python List Comprensions](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/usc/ListComps.ppt) [.ppt]

**Emma**: "[Hello world!](http://djangolookslikefun.wordpress.com/2011/10/22/lightning-talk-hello-world/)" (an encore by popular demand)

**Leo**: I can't remember at the moment but I'm sure it was fabulous!

[Cars.com](http://cars.com) generously hosted a post-workshop PyLadies social hour, plying us with beer and delicious appetizers from the campus bar. Thanks to Michael and Robin from Cars for giving up their Saturday for us!  Likewise to our brilliant volunteer corps -- the event would not have been as successful without your participation and we are grateful! =)

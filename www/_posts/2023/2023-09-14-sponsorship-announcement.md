**Join us! Become a sponsor of the first ever Global PyLadies conference!**

All summer we have been busy planning the first ever global PyLadies Conference, and now we'd like to invite you to be a part of our inaugural event. 

As you know, PyLadies is active around the world, with over 200 chapters on every continent (well, almost - sorry, Antarctica!) helping to provide women with mentorship, training, and conference grants. Those initiatives help build the diversity of our Python communities everywhere by building a bridge to Python development and open source contributions.

**Help make the first ever global PyLadies conference a reality**

Our conference is fully online, and run entirely by volunteers.  We are intentionally making it free, online, inclusive, and accessible, so that as  many of our members as possible can benefit from it in order to further advance their careers. Your sponsorship of the first PyLadies Conference will make it possible to offer that experience to women everywhere. And by being a sponsor you and your company will gain exposure to PyLadies and Pythonistas around as partners in our mission to include more women in Python and open source. 

If you're interested in supporting our work,you can check out the options in our sponsor prospectus now available at https://conference.pyladies.com/sponsors, or you can get in touch with our sponsorship team at [sponsors@pyladies.com](mailto:sponsors@pyladies.com).

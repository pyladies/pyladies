Hello amazing PyLadies!

We have an exciting opportunity for your PyLadies Chapter to shine at the upcoming PyLadiesCon! We invite you to create and share a 90-second video (1 minute 30 sec) introducing your wonderful community. Hereâ€™s a guide to help craft your video:

**Participants:** One member from your community can present.

**Introduction:** Please introduce the organizers with their names and roles in the community.

**Scripting:** Consider preparing a script to succinctly convey the essence of your chapter's story and activities.

**Presentation Material:** Feel free to use our specially designed PyLadiesCon template for your video [**<u>Slides Template</u>**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12NsWhqr7Xg0TYJjopxdcRXS0YhUuj7ro/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117989246016268054271&rtpof=true&sd=true). If you have pre-existing materials, simply add the PyLadiesCon event logo.

**Submission:** Submit your recorded video in advance; it will be showcased during the event.

ðŸš€ Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of what to include:

- A brief introduction of your chapter and its mission.

- Highlights of your communityâ€™s achievements and activities.

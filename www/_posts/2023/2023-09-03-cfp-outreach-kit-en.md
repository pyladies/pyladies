# PyLadiesCon CFP Outreach Kit (English)

Dear PyLadies organizers, members, and supporters,

We need your help in spreading the news of PyLadiesCon. You, as one of our organizers,
members, and supporters, can help in reaching out to individuals who could be a
great speaker for the conference, and who might not have heard of the conference.
Your connection and introduction will help make our conference great.

We encourage you to invite potential speakers to submit a talk to PyLadies Conference,
this could be:

- Someone who have given talks at your event or an event that you attended (i.e another conference)
- Someone who showed interest in giving a talk
- Someone who has not given a talk but you know they’ve done interesting work/project that is worth sharing

You can help us in a variety of ways:

**1. Reach out to individuals by sending them an email or private message.**
   
   Use your own wordings, or feel free to use one of the following:

   > Hi {name}, we’re looking for a speaker at the first PyLadiesCon.
   > Your talk {example talk} was really interesting. Can you submit your talk here?
   > https://pretalx.com/pyladiescon-2023/cfp


   > Hi {name}, would you be interested in giving a talk at PyLadiesCon? Please
   > submit a proposal here https://pretalx.com/pyladiescon-2023/cfp

   > Hi {name}, PyLadiesCon is looking for speakers, and I think you’d be great for it.

   > Hi {name}, I saw your blog post/project about {something}. I think it would be

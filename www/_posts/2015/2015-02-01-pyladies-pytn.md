PyLadies at PyTN 2015
=====================

[PyTennessee](https://www.pytennessee.org/)
will be kicking off its second annual event on Feb 6th to 8th, 2015
in Nashville, TN.

The speaker lineup looks strong and a broad representation of Python's
many uses. [PyTennessee's blog](http://pytennessee.tumblr.com/) profiles some
of the speakers including some fabulous PyLadies. It's interesting reading
and fun to see what other Pythonistas are working on.

###Friday night

Things will be getting started with a PyLadies Dinner hosted by Eventbrite.
Rumor has it that there will be PyLadies cupcakes for dessert. Yum!

###Saturday

We love the workshops for
[Young Coders](https://www.pytennessee.org/young-coders/). Katie Cunningham
and her team will be sharing some fun coding activities and very colorful
Raspberry Pis with 12 to 17 year olds.

###Sunday

A special day devoted to PyLadies awesomeness and our positive impact on the
Python community. There's also a pretty special person giving the closing
keynote.

Thanks to all who have been working on organizing and preparing this event.
We're looking forward to a fun time in the 'Music City'.


Coming soon
-----------
Later this month, Southern California PyLadies groups are going to SCALE 13x
(Southern California Linux Expo). PyLadies will be having a booth in the
expo. If you will be attending or speaking at
[SCALE 13x](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x), please let us know or
stop by the booth.


Share your ideas and good news
------------------------------
Do you or a PyLadies friend love to write? Do you have a handy tip to share?
Are you working on a project that would like to welcome other PyLadies?

We would love to hear about it. Please consider jotting down your thoughts
and submitting it to the PyLadies website. It's cool to hear what things
are going on in your chapter.

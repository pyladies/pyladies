**TL;DR**: [Donate](#ways-to-donate) to PyLadies for PyCon!

It's that time again! With [PyCon 2015][0] planning in high gear, PyLadies is revving up to raise funds to help women attend the biggest Python conference of the year.

Last year, we raised **$40,000**. We're hoping to do that again to help women attend PyCon.  Here's the breakdown:

### Our numbers

* In addition to registration, it will take about $500-1000 per woman in North America to attend PyCon 2015 in Montreal
* In addition to registration, it will take about $1000-2000 per woman outside of North America to attend PyCon 2015 in Montreal

### Why PyLadies? Our effect on the community
_(percentages are not at all accurate, and are roughly estimated based on guessing names-to-gender scripts):_

* PyCon 2011 had less than 10% women attendees (speaker % unknown)
* PyLadies started in late 2011
* PyCon 2012 had about 11% women attendees, and about the same in speakers.
    * This included giving PyLadies and [Women Who Code][8] booths to help promote our messages
* At the time of PyCon 2014, PyLadies had over [35 chapters][7], doing stuff like:
    * hosts events like learning python, learning git/github,
    * providing space for study groups,
    * enriching members with speaker series (like Guido van Rossum!),
    * events to help think up of talks to submit for PyCon (as well as DjangoCon),
    * hold events for folks to practice their talk, etc
* PyLadies work showed:
    * PyCon 2013 had over 20% women attendees, and about 22% women speakers.
    * PyCon 2014 had over 30% women attendees, and about a third of the speakers were women.
* No overhead - we're all volunteers! ;-)
* Lastly, donations tax deductible since PyLadies is under the financial enclave of the Python Software Foundation

### What we're actively doing:

* We're using all of the $12k that PyLadies raised at last year's PyCon auction to increase the aid pool - something that we were hoping to actually use towards growing PyLadies locations (but it's okay! $10k for more women friends at PyCon!)
* We're bugging companies and individuals do donate (hence this blog post!).

### What you will get in return

* Unless you explicitly choose to be anonymous (though the [online donation site][5] or in private discussions), we will profusely thank you via our public channels (Twitter, this blog, and at our PyCon booth)
* Provide a detailed write-up and financial introspection of how many women we've helped because of this campaign
* Visibility! It shows the PyCon/Python community that your company/you are serious about women in tech - which can directly benefit sponsors with increased hiring pool of female Pythonistas.


### Ways to donate

All of the following methods are tax-deductible with funds going to the [Python Software Foundation][1], a 501(c)3 charitable organization.

* Through our [donation page][4] (ideal for individuals)
* Email me at [lynn@lynnroot.com][2] (ideal for companies or anyone needing a proper invoice, or individualized solutions)
* Become a [sponsor][6] for PyCon (this is more indirect and less potent, but overall helpful to PyCon)


More information is available on the [PyCon Financial Aid][5] site if you would like to apply for financial aid for PyCon, whether you are a PyLady or PyGent.

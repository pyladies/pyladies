__TL;DR: Donate to PyLadies for PyCon!__

With [PyCon 2017](https://us.pycon.org/2017/) planning in high gear, PyLadies is revving up to raise funds to help women attend the biggest Python conference of the year.

This year, we’re hoping to raise at least $20,000 to help women attend this coming PyCon. Here’s the breakdown:

__OUR NUMBERS__
In addition to registration, it will take about $500-1000 per woman in North America to attend PyCon 2017 in Portland, Oregon.
In addition to registration, it will take about $1000-2000 per woman outside of North America to attend PyCon 2017.

__WHY PYLADIES? OUR EFFECT ON THE COMMUNITY__
(percentages are roughly estimated based on guessing names-to-gender scripts):
* PyCon 2011 had less than 10% women attendees (speaker % unknown)
* PyLadies started in late 2011
* PyCon 2012 had about 11% women attendees, and about the same in speakers. 2013 with about 14 chapters, PyCon had over 20% women attendees and 22% women speakers.
* For PyCon 2014, we saw that about one-third of attendees and speakers were women.

__WHERE DOES YOUR MONEY GO?__
* Pyladies has no overhead - we’re all volunteers! ;-)
* Your donations are tax deductible since PyLadies is under the financial enclave of the Python Software Foundation

__WHAT YOU WILL GET IN RETURN?__
* Unless you explicitly choose to be anonymous (though the online donation site or in private discussions), we will promote and profusely thank you via our public channels ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/pyladies), this blog, and at our PyCon booth)
*Provide a detailed write-up and financial introspection of how many women we’ve helped because of this campaign
*Visibility! It shows the PyCon/Python community that your company/you are serious about women in tech - which can directly benefit sponsors with increased hiring pool of female Pythonistas.

__WAYS TO DONATE__
All of the following methods are tax-deductible with funds going to the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/), a 501©3 charitable organization.

* Through our [donation page](https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=6) (ideal for individuals)
* Email me at jess@pyladies.com (ideal for companies or anyone needing a proper invoice, or individualized solutions)
* Become a sponsor for PyCon (this is more indirect and less potent, but overall helpful to PyCon)
* More information is available on the [PyCon Financial Aid](https://us.pycon.org/2017/financial-assistance/) site if you would like to apply for financial aid for PyCon, whether you are a PyLady or PyGent.

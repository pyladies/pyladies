            <h2>PyLadies Intro to Python Workshop</h2>
            <h3>May 22, 2011 | Tag: <span>&raquo;</span> <a href="/tags/Events/">Events</a></h3>

            <p>On Sunday, May 15, 2011, the PyLadies held an Intro to Python workshop at KPCC&#39;s Crawford Family Forum in Pasadena.</p>

<p>The goal was to create a safe, comfortable space for women to learn Python programming and be able to ask questions openly. Men were welcome as volunteers or as the +1 guests of women.</p>

<p>It was clear that this was a gathering of educated, sharp, successful women. Our <strong>female</strong> attendees included:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Grad students from UCLA and CalTech, and over-educated women with multiple degrees and Ph.Ds.</li>
<li>  Senior marketers and community managers with over 10,000 Twitter followers, working on prominent tech projects</li>
<li>  UX (user experience) professionals working for top companies</li>
<li>  Research scientists currently using other languages in their labs for numerical analysis</li>
<li>  Co-founders of startups, with 1 or more funded and/or successful companies under their belt</li>
<li>  Experienced software engineers with Java, C++, .NET, PHP backgrounds</li>
<li>  Product managers at top companies</li>
<li>  Talented Linux sysadmins</li>
<li>  Hardware hackers involved with the various LA area hackerspaces</li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on and on. Many were happily employed, but some were looking for technical jobs. I&#39;m hoping some of the job seekers apply to work at KPCC, our venue sponsor!</p>

<p>In the morning, Katharine and I did a walkthrough of the popular <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> tutorial by Zed Shaw. Attendees typed along with each exercise. At the end of each exercise, we reviewed the new concepts covered.</p>

<p>During lunch, KPCC&#39;s senior web producer Jason Georges took everyone on a tour behind the scenes of the radio station. KPCC is full of cool things like soundproof glass cube recording rooms.</p>

<p>Then we were greeted by former NFL player and pastry chef George Wrighster with a surprise tray of cupcakes from his bakery, <a href="http://www.violetscakes.com/">Violet&#39;s Cakes</a>. Yummy!</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we split up into smaller breakout sessions:</p>

<ul>
<li>  craping the Web with Python, or How I Automatically Get Happy Hour Specials Delivered to my Inbox</li>
<li>  Intro to Django with the Django Poll Tutorial</li>
<li>  Learn Python The Hard Way, Part 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the PyLadies volunteer organizers gave lightning talks:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Equality: Equivalence in Python by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tiny_mouse">Jess Stanton</a></li>
<li>  Project Euler Demo by <a href="http://www.xtine.net/">Christine Cheung</a></li>
<li>  Python Web Frameworks by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kjam">Katharine Jarmul</a></li>
<li>  Generators by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sandymahalo">Sandy Strong</a></li>
<li>  Ergonomics by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/estherbester">Esther Nam</a></li>
<li>  The Code Behind PyLadies.com by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/audreyr">Audrey Roy</a></li>
<li>  Inequality: Stories from the Python &amp; Developer Communities by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tiny_mouse">Jess Stanton</a></li>
</ul>

<p>At the end, we celebrated over root beer floats. It was interesting and exciting to see that no one wanted to leave at the end! I was thrilled and floating on a cloud, and so were all the other organizers and volunteers.</p>

<p>Thank you to our special out-of-town guests! If there&#39;s anything we can do to help you in any way with your local women&#39;s developer communities, let us know.</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thisgirlangie">Angie Chang</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://www.women2.org/">Women 2.0</a> <a href="http://www.bayareagirlgeekdinners.com/">Bay Area Girl Geek dinners</a> &amp; product manager at Zinch from SF, who flew into LA just for our event</li>
<li>  <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/heatherpayne">Heather Payne</a>, senior marketing coordinator for a global staffing/HR firm from Toronto, who flew home <a href="http://heatherpayne.ca/review-of-pyladies-intro-to-python-workshop">eager to start a local women&#39;s Python coding group</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations to all 25 ladies and 2 men who completed our intro workshop, and special thanks to all the men who attended and volunteered for braving the crowd of ladies.</p>

# Code of Conduct

Pymen is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone. We do not
tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. This does not only extend to
members to local PyMen communities, but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger
PyMen community of users, developers and integrators through events or interactions.

Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal characteristics or choices,
sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking,
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, IRC chats, electronic
meetings, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual
attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the community may take reasonable
action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any PyMen event, or
expulsion from mailing lists, IRC chats, discussion boards and other electronic communications channels
to resolve the issue. This may include expulsion from PyMen Meetup group membership.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
act to intercede or ask for help from any member of the PyMen community, IRC chat admins, website
admins, or organizers/representatives of any physical events put on under the auspices of PyMen.
